# KERNELS Docs

Documentation for understanding and integrating KERNELS.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Component boundaries and data flows |
| [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md) | Adversary model + mitigations |
| [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) | Usage clarifications and non-goals |

## Getting Started

If you need to integrate KERNELS:

1. Start at the main [README.md](../README.md) for overview
2. Read [spec/README.md](../spec/README.md) for normative requirements
3. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for implementation details
4. Check [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) for common questions

## Relationship to Spec

The `/spec` directory contains **normative** requirements. This `/docs` directory contains **informative** guidance. If they conflict, spec wins.
