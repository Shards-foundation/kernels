# KERNELS Rulebook

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Classification:** Governance  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 1. Overview

This rulebook defines the operational rules, policies, and constraints that govern KERNELS deployments. All operators must adhere to these rules.

---

## 2. Fundamental Rules

### Rule 1: Fail-Closed is Mandatory

> **The kernel MUST deny by default. No implicit allows.**

**Rationale:** Safety requires explicit permission for every action.

**Enforcement:**
- Default policy denies all requests
- Every ALLOW must be explicitly configured
- Ambiguous requests result in DENY

**Violations:**
- Configuring default-allow policies
- Bypassing jurisdiction checks
- Ignoring validation failures

---

### Rule 2: Audit Everything

> **Every decision MUST be recorded before it takes effect.**

**Rationale:** Accountability requires complete audit trail.

**Enforcement:**
- Audit entry created before state transition
- No decision without corresponding entry
- Hash chain maintains integrity

**Violations:**
- Executing without audit entry
- Modifying audit entries
- Deleting audit history

---

### Rule 3: Halt is Sacred

> **The ability to halt MUST never be compromised.**

**Rationale:** Emergency stop is the ultimate safety mechanism.

**Enforcement:**
- Halt available from any non-terminal state
- Halt is immediate and unconditional
- No operation can prevent halt

**Violations:**
- Disabling halt capability
- Delaying halt execution
- Requiring approval for halt

---

### Rule 4: Separation of Concerns

> **Each component has exactly one responsibility.**

**Rationale:** Clear boundaries enable security and maintainability.

**Enforcement:**
- Kernel decides, does not execute
- Workers execute, do not decide
- Sensors observe, do not act
- Cockpit displays, does not bypass

**Violations:**
- Kernel making external calls
- Workers making decisions
- Sensors modifying state

---

### Rule 5: Evidence is Immutable

> **Once recorded, evidence MUST NOT be modified.**

**Rationale:** Integrity requires immutability.

**Enforcement:**
- Append-only ledger
- Hash chain verification
- No update or delete operations

**Violations:**
- Modifying existing entries
- Deleting entries
- Breaking hash chain

---

4. Remediation actions
5. Prevention measures
6. Lessons learned

**Timeline:**

---

### Rule 9: Changes Follow Process

> **All changes MUST follow the change management process.**

**Change Categories:**

| Category | Approval | Testing |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Emergency | 1 approver | Post-deploy |
| Standard | 2 approvers | Pre-deploy |
| Major | 3 approvers | Full cycle |

**Change Window:**
- Standard: Tuesday-Thursday, 10:00-16:00 UTC
- Emergency: Any time with approval
- Major: Scheduled maintenance window

---

### Rule 10: Monitoring is Required

> **All production kernels MUST be monitored.**

**Required Metrics:**

| Metric | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-----------------|
| Kernel state | != IDLE for > 5 min |
| Decision latency | p99 > 100ms |
| Deny rate | > 50% in 5 min |
| Error rate | > 1% in 5 min |
| Audit chain | Any verification failure |

**Required Dashboards:**
- Kernel health
- Decision distribution
- Latency percentiles
- Error breakdown

---

## 4. Security Rules

### Rule 11: Least Privilege

> **Actors and tools MUST have minimum necessary permissions.**

**Implementation:**
- Enumerate specific actors, not wildcards
- Enumerate specific tools, not wildcards
- Review permissions quarterly
- Remove unused permissions

**Anti-Patterns:**
- `allowed_actors: ["*"]`
- `allowed_tools: ["*"]`
- Permissions "just in case"

---

### Rule 12: Defense in Depth

> **Multiple layers of protection MUST be maintained.**

**Layers:**

| Layer | Control |
|-------|---------|
| Network | Firewall, TLS |
| Authentication | Token verification |
| Authorization | Jurisdiction policy |
| Audit | Hash-chained ledger |
| Monitoring | Anomaly detection |

**No single layer is sufficient.**

---

### Rule 13: Secrets Management

> **Secrets MUST be managed securely.**

**Requirements:**
- Secrets in vault, not code
- Rotation every 90 days
- Access logging
- Encryption in transit and at rest

**Prohibited:**
- Secrets in source code
- Secrets in logs
- Shared secrets
- Permanent secrets

---

### Rule 14: Vulnerability Response

> **Vulnerabilities MUST be addressed within SLA.**

**Response SLAs:**

| Severity | Response | Remediation |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 24 hours |
