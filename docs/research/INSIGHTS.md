## 1. Overview

This document captures research insights, design decisions, and lessons learned during the development of KERNELS.

---

## 2. Key Insights

### 2.1 Insight: Governance Must Be Architectural

**Observation:** Advisory governance (logging, monitoring) does not prevent unauthorized actions.

**Insight:** True governance requires architectural enforcement—the system must be physically incapable of executing unauthorized actions.

**Implication:** KERNELS interposes between intent and execution, making governance a structural property rather than a behavioral one.

**Evidence:**
- Systems with advisory governance still experience unauthorized actions
- Post-hoc analysis cannot undo harm
- Architectural enforcement provides mathematical guarantees

---

### 2.2 Insight: Fail-Closed Is Non-Negotiable

**Observation:** Systems that fail-open eventually fail catastrophically.

**Insight:** The only safe default is denial. Explicit permission must be required for every action.

**Implication:** KERNELS denies by default. Every ALLOW is explicit and audited.

**Evidence:**
- Security breaches often exploit implicit permissions
- "Fail-safe" systems that fail-open are not actually safe
- Explicit permission creates clear accountability

---

### 2.3 Insight: Determinism Enables Verification

**Observation:** Non-deterministic systems cannot be fully verified.

**Insight:** Deterministic decision-making enables external verification, replay, and audit.

**Implication:** KERNELS uses pure functions with no side effects in the decision path.

**Evidence:**
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- Decisions can be replayed and verified
- External auditors can independently verify

---

### 2.4 Insight: Separation of Concerns Is Security

**Observation:** Systems where components have multiple responsibilities are harder to secure.

**Insight:** Each component should have exactly one job. This limits blast radius and simplifies analysis.

**Implication:** KERNELS separates governance (kernel), execution (workers), observation (sensors), and management (cockpit).

**Evidence:**
- Single-responsibility components are easier to audit
- Compromised components have limited impact
- Clear boundaries enable defense in depth

---

### 2.5 Insight: Hash Chains Provide Tamper Evidence

**Observation:** Append-only logs can be modified without detection.

**Insight:** Cryptographic hash chains make tampering detectable.

**Implication:** KERNELS uses SHA-256 hash chains for the audit ledger.

**Evidence:**
- Any modification breaks the chain
- Verification is computationally cheap
- External parties can verify independently

---

### 2.6 Insight: Halt Must Always Be Available

**Observation:** Systems without emergency stop mechanisms can cause unbounded harm.

**Insight:** The ability to halt must be unconditional and immediate.

**Implication:** KERNELS allows halt from any non-terminal state.

**Evidence:**
- Runaway processes need kill switches
- Halt is the ultimate safety mechanism
- No operation should be able to prevent halt

---

### 2.7 Insight: Evidence Should Be Exportable

**Observation:** Internal audit logs are insufficient for external verification.

**Insight:** Evidence must be exportable in a format that external parties can verify.

**Implication:** KERNELS exports evidence bundles with all information needed for independent verification.

**Evidence:**
- Regulators require verifiable records
- External auditors need complete evidence
- Self-attestation is not sufficient

---

### 2.8 Insight: Variants Enable Flexibility Without Compromising Core

**Observation:** Different use cases require different enforcement postures.

**Insight:** Kernel variants can provide flexibility while preserving core invariants.

**Implication:** KERNELS provides four variants (Strict, Permissive, EvidenceFirst, DualChannel) that all satisfy the core invariants.

**Evidence:**
- Development needs differ from production
- Some domains require evidence for every action
- Structured proposals reduce ambiguity

---

## 3. Design Decisions

### 3.1 Decision: Zero External Dependencies

**Context:** Dependencies introduce supply chain risk and complexity.

**Decision:** KERNELS uses only Python standard library.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces attack surface
- Simplifies auditing
- Eliminates supply chain risk
- Enables deployment anywhere

**Trade-offs:**
- Must implement some utilities ourselves
- Cannot use popular libraries
- May duplicate effort

---

### 3.2 Decision: Synchronous Processing

**Context:** Async processing is complex and harder to reason about.

**Decision:** KERNELS processes requests synchronously.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler mental model
- Easier to test
- Deterministic ordering
- Clear state transitions

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower throughput than async
- Blocking on slow operations
- May need multiple kernel instances for scale

---

### 3.3 Decision: In-Memory Ledger

**Context:** Persistent storage adds complexity and failure modes.

**Decision:** KERNELS uses in-memory ledger with export capability.

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies implementation
- Eliminates database dependencies
- Fast operation
- Export provides persistence

**Trade-offs:**
- Data lost on crash
- Memory limits ledger size
- Must export regularly

---

### 3.4 Decision: Dataclasses Over Pydantic

**Context:** Pydantic provides validation but adds dependency.

**Decision:** KERNELS uses Python dataclasses with manual validation.

**Rationale:**
- Zero dependencies
- Sufficient for our needs
- Full control over validation
- Simpler debugging

**Trade-offs:**
- More validation code
- No automatic serialization
- Less feature-rich

---

### 3.5 Decision: SHA-256 for Hashing

**Context:** Need cryptographic hash for chain integrity.

**Decision:** KERNELS uses SHA-256.

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard
- No known practical attacks
- Available in stdlib
- Sufficient security margin

**Trade-offs:**
- Slower than non-crypto hashes
- 256 bits may be overkill
- Future-proofing uncertain

## 4. Lessons Learned

### 4.1 Lesson: Start with Invariants

**Experience:** Early prototypes focused on features, not guarantees.

**Lesson:** Define invariants first, then implement to preserve them.

**Application:** KERNELS defines ten invariants that all code must preserve.

---

### 4.2 Lesson: Test Invariants Explicitly

**Experience:** Unit tests don't automatically verify invariants.

**Lesson:** Write explicit tests for each invariant.

**Application:** KERNELS has dedicated invariant tests.

---

### 4.3 Lesson: Documentation Is Part of the Product

**Experience:** Code without documentation is incomplete.

**Lesson:** Treat documentation as first-class deliverable.

**Application:** KERNELS has extensive spec, docs, and examples.

---

### 4.4 Lesson: Variants Should Share Core

**Experience:** Copy-paste variants diverge over time.

**Lesson:** Variants should inherit from a common base.

**Application:** KERNELS variants extend BaseKernel.

---

### 4.5 Lesson: Examples Are Tests

**Experience:** Examples that don't run are useless.

**Lesson:** Examples should be executable and tested.

**Application:** KERNELS examples are run in CI.

**Question:** How should multiple kernels coordinate?

**Considerations:**

**Status:** Open for research

---

### 5.2 Question: Formal Verification

**Question:** Can we formally prove invariant preservation?

**Considerations:**
- Python is hard to verify formally
- May need reference implementation
- Cost vs. benefit

**Status:** Exploring options

---

### 5.3 Question: Hardware Security

**Question:** Should signing keys be in HSMs?

**Considerations:**
- HSMs add operational complexity
- Higher security for high-stakes
- Cost and availability

**Status:** Recommended for production

---

### 5.4 Question: Real-Time Constraints

**Question:** Can KERNELS meet real-time deadlines?

**Considerations:**
- Python GC is unpredictable
