# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product:** KERNELS — Deterministic Control Planes for AI Systems  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** Development  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

KERNELS is a deterministic control plane that governs AI agent execution through explicit jurisdiction, fail-closed arbitration, and append-only hash-chained audit. It solves the operational problem of ungoverned agent systems that fail in predictable, dangerous ways.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Ungoverned AI agent systems exhibit five critical failure modes:

| Failure Mode | Business Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Ambiguity escapes into execution | Unauditable actions, liability exposure |
| Implicit state drift | Post-hoc analysis impossible |
| Tool reach exceeds operator intent | Unauthorized operations |
| Advisory logs | Incomplete audit trails |
| Accountability diffusion | No provenance for decisions |

### 1.2 Solution

KERNELS provides a deterministic state machine that sits between operators (humans with authority) and agents (AI systems that execute). Every action requires explicit approval, every decision is audited, and ambiguity results in denial.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Metric |
|----|------|----------------|
| G1 | Deterministic arbitration | 100% reproducible decisions given same inputs |
| G2 | Complete audit trail | Zero missing transitions in ledger |
| G3 | Fail-closed semantics | Zero implicit allows |
| G4 | Jurisdiction enforcement | Zero out-of-scope executions |
| G5 | Evidence exportability | Any decision verifiable externally |

### 2.2 Non-Goals

| ID | Non-Goal | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | LLM integration | Kernel governs, doesn't call models |
| NG2 | Prompt engineering | Not a prompt framework |
| NG3 | Agent behavior definition | Constrains, doesn't define |
| NG4 | Value alignment | Operational boundaries, not ethics |
| NG5 | Visualization/dashboards | Outputs evidence, display is external |

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1 Operator (Primary)

**Role:** Human with authority over AI system deployment

**Needs:**
- Define jurisdiction policies
- Review audit evidence
- Issue halt commands
- Approve high-risk actions

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot prove why AI took an action
- No single source of truth for decisions
- Agents exceed intended scope

### 3.2 Developer (Secondary)

**Role:** Engineer integrating KERNELS into AI systems

**Needs:**
- Clear API surface
- Deterministic behavior for testing
- Extensible tool registry
- Comprehensive documentation

**Pain Points:**
- Non-deterministic AI behavior
- Difficult to test agent systems
- Unclear failure modes

### 3.3 Auditor (Tertiary)

**Role:** Compliance/security reviewer

**Needs:**
- Complete audit trails
- Verifiable evidence bundles
- Replay capability
- Hash chain integrity

**Pain Points:**
- Incomplete logs
- Non-reproducible decisions
- Missing provenance
