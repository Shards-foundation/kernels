## 2. Code Security Analysis

### 2.1 Input Validation

**Location:** `kernels/common/validate.py`

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Type validation | ✅ Pass | Dataclass enforcement |
| Bounds checking | ✅ Pass | Size limits on params |
| Injection prevention | ✅ Pass | No string interpolation in queries |
| Encoding validation | ⚠️ Review | UTF-8 assumed |

**Recommendation:** Add explicit encoding validation for all string inputs.

### 2.2 Cryptographic Implementation

**Location:** `kernels/common/hashing.py`

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Algorithm choice | ✅ Pass | SHA-256 (NIST approved) |
| Hash chain integrity | ✅ Pass | Proper prev_hash linking |
| Genesis hash | ✅ Pass | Deterministic zero-hash |
| Timing safety | ⚠️ Review | Use constant-time compare |

**Code Review:**

```python
# Current implementation
def compute_hash(data: str, algorithm: str = "sha256") -> str:
    if algorithm != "sha256":
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported algorithm: {algorithm}")
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

**Recommendation:** Add constant-time comparison for hash verification:

```python
import hmac

def secure_compare(a: str, b: str) -> bool:
    """Constant-time string comparison to prevent timing attacks."""
    return hmac.compare_digest(a.encode(), b.encode())
```

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| State enumeration | ✅ Pass | Explicit enum |
| Transition validation | ✅ Pass | Whitelist approach |
| Terminal state handling | ✅ Pass | HALTED is irrevocable |
| Race condition protection | ⚠️ Review | Single-threaded assumed |

**Recommendation:** Add thread safety for multi-threaded deployments:

```python
import threading

class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        
    def transition(self, to_state: KernelState) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            # ... transition logic
```

### 2.4 Jurisdiction Policy

**Location:** `kernels/jurisdiction/policy.py`

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Default deny | ✅ Pass | Explicit allow required |
| Policy immutability | ✅ Pass | Frozen after creation |
| Actor validation | ✅ Pass | Whitelist approach |
| Tool validation | ✅ Pass | Whitelist approach |
