# Kernels Specification

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the normative requirements for Kernels, a deterministic control plane for AI systems.

### 1.1 Scope

This specification covers:

- Core types and their semantics
- State machine definition and transitions
- Jurisdiction policy evaluation
- Audit ledger structure and verification
- Kernel API surface
- Invariant definitions

### 1.2 Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 2. Core Invariants

A conforming implementation MUST satisfy all of the following invariants:

### INV-STATE

The kernel MUST be in exactly one defined state at any time. The defined states are: BOOTING, IDLE, VALIDATING, ARBITRATING, EXECUTING, AUDITING, HALTED.

### INV-TRANSITION

State transitions MUST occur only through defined transition functions. Implementations MUST NOT allow implicit state changes.

### INV-JURISDICTION

Every request MUST pass jurisdiction checks before execution. Requests that fail jurisdiction MUST be denied.

### INV-AUDIT

Every state transition MUST produce an append-only audit entry before the transition completes.

### INV-HASH-CHAIN

Audit entries MUST be hash-chained. Each entry MUST include the hash of the previous entry.

### INV-FAIL-CLOSED

Ambiguous, malformed, or unhandled requests MUST result in DENY or HALT. The kernel MUST NOT proceed under uncertainty.

### INV-DETERMINISM

Given identical inputs and initial state, the kernel MUST produce identical outputs and final state.

### INV-HALT

The kernel MUST support immediate halt from any non-terminal state. Halt MUST be irrevocable within a session.

### INV-EVIDENCE

All decisions MUST be exportable as an evidence bundle with verifiable hash chain.

### INV-NO-IMPLICIT-ALLOW

The absence of a DENY is not an ALLOW. Explicit ALLOW decisions MUST be required for execution.

## 4. Kernel API

A conforming kernel implementation MUST provide the following methods:

### 4.1 boot

```
boot(config: KernelConfig) -> None
```

Initialize the kernel with configuration. MUST transition from BOOTING to IDLE. MUST raise BootError if boot fails.

### 4.2 get_state

```
get_state() -> KernelState
```

Return the current kernel state. MUST NOT modify state.

### 4.3 submit

```
submit(request: KernelRequest) -> KernelReceipt
```

Submit a request for processing. MUST validate request, evaluate jurisdiction, execute if allowed, and produce audit entry. MUST return receipt with decision.

### 4.4 step

```
step() -> KernelReceipt | None
```

Advance the kernel by one step. MUST return receipt if step was taken, None if idle.

### 4.5 halt

```
halt(reason: str) -> KernelReceipt
```

Halt the kernel. MUST transition to HALTED from any non-terminal state. MUST produce audit entry.

### 4.6 export_evidence

```
export_evidence() -> EvidenceBundle
```

Export the audit ledger as evidence. MUST include all entries and root hash.

## 5. Lifecycle

### 5.1 Request Processing

A conforming implementation MUST process requests in the following sequence:

1. Receive request via `submit()`
2. Transition to VALIDATING
3. Validate request structure
4. Check ambiguity heuristics
5. Transition to ARBITRATING
6. Evaluate jurisdiction policy
7. Check variant requirements
8. Make decision
9. If ALLOW and tool_call present, transition to EXECUTING
10. Execute tool call
11. Transition to AUDITING
12. Create audit entry
13. Transition to IDLE
14. Return receipt

### 5.2 Failure Handling

On any failure during processing:

1. MUST NOT proceed with execution
2. MUST produce audit entry with error
3. MUST return receipt with appropriate status
4. MUST return to IDLE or HALTED state

## 6. Verification

### 6.1 Replay Verification

To verify an audit ledger:

1. Initialize prev_hash to genesis hash (64 zeros)
2. For each entry in sequence:
   a. Verify entry.prev_hash equals prev_hash
   b. Recompute entry hash from fields
   c. Verify computed hash equals entry.entry_hash
   d. Set prev_hash to entry.entry_hash
3. Verify final prev_hash equals root_hash

### 6.2 Evidence Bundle Verification

To verify an evidence bundle:

1. Perform replay verification on ledger_entries
2. Verify computed root hash equals bundle.root_hash
