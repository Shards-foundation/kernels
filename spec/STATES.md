# State Machine Specification

**Version:** 0.1.0

## 1. State Definitions

The kernel state machine defines exactly seven states. A conforming implementation MUST support all states and MUST NOT define additional states.

### 1.1 BOOTING

**Description:** Kernel is initializing and loading configuration.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Kernel instantiation

**Exit Conditions:**
- Configuration loaded successfully → IDLE
- Configuration load failure → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- No requests SHALL be accepted in BOOTING state
- Duration SHOULD be minimal

### 1.2 IDLE

**Description:** Kernel is ready to accept requests.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Successful boot from BOOTING
- Successful audit completion from AUDITING

**Exit Conditions:**
- Request received → VALIDATING
- Halt command → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- Kernel MUST accept requests only in IDLE state
- No pending operations SHALL exist in IDLE state

### 1.3 VALIDATING

**Description:** Kernel is checking request structure and required fields.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Request submitted from IDLE

**Exit Conditions:**
- Validation passed → ARBITRATING
- Validation failed → AUDITING (with DENY)
- Fatal error → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- Validation MUST be deterministic
- Validation MUST NOT have side effects

### 1.4 ARBITRATING

**Description:** Kernel is evaluating jurisdiction policy and making decision.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Validation passed from VALIDATING

**Exit Conditions:**
- Decision ALLOW with tool_call → EXECUTING
- Decision ALLOW without tool_call → AUDITING
- Decision DENY → AUDITING
- Decision HALT → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- Arbitration MUST evaluate all policy rules
- Arbitration MUST NOT modify request

### 1.5 EXECUTING

**Description:** Kernel is dispatching tool call and capturing result.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Decision ALLOW with tool_call from ARBITRATING

**Exit Conditions:**
- Execution complete → AUDITING
- Execution failure → AUDITING (with error)
- Fatal error → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- Execution MUST be synchronous
- Execution MUST capture result or error

### 1.6 AUDITING

**Description:** Kernel is writing audit entry for completed operation.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Validation failure from VALIDATING
- Arbitration complete from ARBITRATING
- Execution complete from EXECUTING

**Exit Conditions:**
- Audit entry written → IDLE
- Audit failure → HALTED

**Invariants:**
- Audit entry MUST be written before state change
- Audit entry MUST include all required fields

### 1.7 HALTED

**Description:** Terminal state, no further operations permitted.

**Entry Conditions:**
- Halt command from any non-terminal state
- Fatal error from any state
- Boot failure from BOOTING

**Exit Conditions:**
- None (terminal state)

**Invariants:**
- No operations SHALL be permitted in HALTED state
- HALTED state MUST be irrevocable

## 2. Transition Matrix

The following matrix defines all allowed transitions. An X indicates the transition is allowed.

| From \ To    | BOOTING | IDLE | VALIDATING | ARBITRATING | EXECUTING | AUDITING | HALTED |
|--------------|---------|------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| BOOTING      | -       | X    | -          | -           | -         | -        | X      |
| IDLE         | -       | -    | X          | -           | -         | -        | X      |
| VALIDATING   | -       | -    | -          | X           | -         | X        | X      |
| ARBITRATING  | -       | -    | -          | -           | X         | X        | X      |
| EXECUTING    | -       | -    | -          | -           | -         | X        | X      |
| AUDITING     | -       | X    | -          | -           | -         | -        | X      |
| HALTED       | -       | -    | -          | -           | -         | -        | -      |

## 3. Transition Rules

### 3.1 General Rules

1. A transition MUST NOT occur unless explicitly defined in the transition matrix.
2. Every transition MUST produce an audit entry (except BOOTING → IDLE).
3. Transitions MUST be atomic with respect to state.
4. The HALTED transition MUST be available from any non-terminal state.

### 3.2 Error Handling

1. Unhandled exceptions MUST result in transition to HALTED.
2. Recoverable errors MUST result in transition to AUDITING with error recorded.
3. The kernel MUST NOT remain in an intermediate state after an error.

### 3.3 Determinism

1. Given the same current state and input, the same transition MUST occur.
2. Transition selection MUST NOT depend on external factors.
3. Time-based decisions MUST use the virtual clock.

## 5. Implementation Requirements

2. The transition function MUST validate the transition is allowed.
3. Invalid transitions MUST raise StateError.
